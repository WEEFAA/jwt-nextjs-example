# JWT with NextJS example

simple auth with Nextjs using JWT


## Disclaimer:

This project is here to demonstrate the use of JWT
to implement cross platform authorization.

TL;DR 

JWT Tokens aren't meant to be used for authentication [although it's possible]. It is commonly used 
for cross authorization across your different APIs [see __End Goal__], not authentication.
